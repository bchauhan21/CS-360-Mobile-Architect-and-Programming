**•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The app I developed is an inventory management app, where user can store items in their inventory and keep track of it. The app works by creating a unique username and password, so each user will have their own account. This app is not specifically designed for particular group of users because it can be helpful to business purposes as well as household purposes.

**•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

As the app requires to make username and password, it was necessary to add the button for creating an account and thereafter adding a button for login. The user will also have an option to go back to their account homepage once they are in menu option. I designed very simple and user-friendly app that it easily useful by any age group. I believe my app design will be successful because I have designed the app in a way that it will be helpful for business purposes as well as household purposes. Another reason, my app will be successful is because it is very user friendly for all age group.

**•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I applied an iterative approach for the process of coding my app. There were many parts of the coding where it needs to be broken down into smaller goals and tasks.

**•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

Testing is very important for the fully functional app. We should do testing as we code, that way any error will be figured out in the early stages. This process is important to avoid any potential errors and bad experiences after the app is released to the client.

**•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

I simply tried to follow the UI components, and maintain the same functionality for my app. 

**•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

The overall design of my mobile app helped me getting successful to use my knowledge towards object-oriented programming and the java programming language.
